# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview
This repo if for the software implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac
Toe. This software will allow two players to play against each other or for one player to play against the
computer. A description of the game plus the requirements of this implementation are provided below.

## The Game
Two players are presented with a 3x3 grid of empty spots. The players take turns marking an empty spot
with their letter: the first player to move is X and the second player is O. The first player to fill a winning
set, defined as a row, column, or diagonal line of three spots, wins. If all spots are filled and neither
player has a winning set, then the game results in a tie.

**The full spec for this software is in the repo docs folder [tic-tac-toe-spec.md](docs/tic-tac-toe-spec.md)**
